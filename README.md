# Enigame
Quiz level game created for a university course.

# Main page example
![Main page](http://s18.postimg.org/jsuldbjxl/main_page.jpg)

The site can be accessed at this address (until domain will be alive):
[Enigame](http://www.enigame.altervista.org).

# Description
Enigame is a game based on levels, and each level contains a different quiz. Higher levels mean higher difficulty (really really hard, for sure).
Site is in italian since it was for a university course in Italy, but if you know or want to learn italian this could be your best opportunity!

# Installation
All the files provided are enough to run the entire project. There's just need to use a development environment to run PHP code (e.g. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/it/index.html) or [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net).
Leave the same hierarchy among files in order to make it work since there same references are in different files.

#Usage
Go on the site [Enigame](http://www.enigame.altervista.org) to try it directly or, once set everything up, launch index.php file and the same will (or, at least should, happen).
Enjoy!

#Tests
The work has been tested meanwhile building phase, without any particular tool but just letting try the site to different people. Some security issues were concerned but nothing in a serious way.

#Clarification
Like real programmers, code is not much documented since we had few time to complete the job LOL.
